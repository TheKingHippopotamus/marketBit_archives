Required Report: Required - Public Distribution Date: July 24, 2025 Report Number: CA2025-0027 Report Name: Grain and Feed Update Country: Canada Post: Ottawa Report Category: Grain and Feed Prepared By: Erin Danielson Approved By: Tacarra Birmingham Report Highlights:
Marketing year (MY) 2025/26 wheat production is under pressure from sub-par spring and winter wheat
conditions in key Prairie provinces—drought is a central challenge. Exports, especially durum, are
strong. The five million metric ton (MT) year-to-date (YTD, as of May 2025) durum exports reflect
robust demand, while non-durum shipments are relatively stable. Feed wheat markets are being
squeezed by competition from alternative grains. Carry-out stocks are tightening in MY 2024/25. Poor
crop recovery or moisture stress could pose further supply risks. The tariff situation is fluid, with
ongoing negotiations and potential changes to trade policies, creating uncertainty in the wheat market.

PRODUCTION – Marketing Year (MY) 2025/20261
FAS/Ottawa forecasts that total wheat production will be 35,150 thousand metric tons (MT), based on Statistics
Canada’s June 27 data update on seeded area, Canada’s three-year average harvest rates, and three-year average
yields of each of the three major wheat classes grown in Canada: spring wheat, durum, and winter wheat.
Ongoing tariffs on canola from China and the United States pushed producers toward spring wheat, boosting
acreage and potentially stabilizing prices amid ample supply. While MY 2025/26 production is forecast to
increase over the previous year, poor crop conditions in regions of Alberta and Saskatchewan could drag down
the current yield forecast, reducing production down from the current forecast.
Provincial government crop reports have reported on crop conditions six to eight weeks ahead of spring wheat
harvest, and a couple weeks ahead of winter wheat harvest. The reports indicate that spring wheat crop conditions
are worse than same time last year in the major growing provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. Winter wheat
conditions in Saskatchewan are also worse than last year, though conditions could turn around before harvest
occurs in August and September. Throughout the Prairie Provinces, only spring wheat conditions in Manitoba faired better than the previous year.

June 30 (SK) in MY 24/25. Manitoba does not provide a province-level estimate of crop conditions -- the percent
associated with Manitoba is an estimate derived from published regional estimates. MY 2024/25 durum wheat is
slightly under-estimated, because it is representative of the seven days ending June 30.
A continuation of hot and dry conditions in the Prairie Provinces could bring Post’s yield forecast down from the
currently forecasted three-year average (MY 2022/2023 to MY 2024/2025), which is 3.27 MT per hectare. This
forecast is higher than Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada’s (AAFC) yield forecast which has sat at 3.18 MT per
hectare since their May 2025 Market Outlook report.
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada’s (AAFC) Canadian Drought Monitor indicates that most Prairie areas are
experiencing abnormally dry to moderate drought.
 Alberta & Saskatchewan: Western regions face moderate to extreme drought; some recovery has been observed in central zones.
 Manitoba: Generally normal to abnormally dry, with southern pockets of moderate drought.
 Ontario and Quebec: Largely unaffected, marked as normal moisture 2

Wildfire smoke can negatively impact crop production, primarily through reduced sunlight and negative affects
on soil health, but an agronomist told Post that the overall impact on yields so far is minimal. The relationship
between wildfire smoke and crop growth is complex, with both positive and negative effects on photosynthesis. In
some years, wildfire smoke was thought to benefit canola crops by cooling them from what would have otherwise
been hot and dry conditions. According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, 3,282 fires have occurred
in Canada so far this year, burning 5.5 million hectares of land. Post is not aware of any cropland loss due to wildfires this year.
# FEED
Post will continue to monitor MY 2025/26 drought condition in Saskatchewan and Alberta for adverse impacts on
animal feed supply. A continuation of dry conditions in these two provinces could lead to reduced supplies and
increased imports of corn and distiller's dried grains with solubles (DDGS) from the United States, though likely 3

## Page 5

not at levels seen in 2022 when U.S. corn and DDGS imports into Canada reached record levels following a drought.
After challenging years marked by drought in 2021 and 2022, the 2024 growing season saw normal to above-
normal precipitation in key feed wheat-producing provinces such as Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba.
Price fluctuations in feed wheat remain highly regionalized in Canada, with provinces like Saskatchewan and
Manitoba seeing slightly lower prices compared to Alberta, where local conditions have sometimes caused supply
shortages. Price differences can also vary based on transportation costs to major export hubs, as well as local supply-and-demand imbalances.
During the week of July 7, feed wheat in Lethbridge, Alberta averaged approximately CA $298/ MT (US $217),
compared to CA $304/ MT (US $ 221) in the same week in 2024, and CA $453/ MT (US $329) in the same week
in 2022. By comparison, feed barley were CA $296/ MT (US $215) the week of July 7, CA $279/ MT (US $203)
in 2024, and CA $410/ MT in 2022 (US $298).
# FOOD CONSUMPTION
Domestic food-grade wheat use remains robust. In 2025, miller and bakery purchases reflect:
 Stable end-use demand, particularly for hard red spring and soft wheat varieties.
 Modest growth in whole-grain and specialty products supporting human consumption.
 Minimal impact from tight supplies, as manufacturers shift to alternate ingredients (e.g., blended flour) or adjust formulations.
The P&H Milling Group’s flour mill in Saskatoon suffered significant fire damage in Jan 2024. It had a milling
capacity of approximately 250 tonnes of wheat per day, producing flour and other wheat-based products for
domestic and export markets. Damage estimates exceeded C$5 million, calling into question the future viability of
the facility and prompting P&H to suspend operations indefinitely while assessing repair timelines No other
significant milling capacity changes have occurred since. A P&H mill is currently being built in Red Deer
County, Alberta, with an estimated daily milling capacity of 750 MT of wheat supplied by Western Canadian
farmers. The mill is expected to be completed by Fall 2026. 4

TRADE Wheat exports – MY 2025/2026
The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) includes provisions for wheat and barley, but some
imports from Canada and Mexico may still face tariffs if they don't meet specific rules of origin.
The imposition of Canadian and U.S. tariffs on key agricultural commodities has added new layers of uncertainty
to Canadian wheat exports, particularly in terms of competitiveness and market access. While wheat itself is not
directly targeted by the current wave of bilateral tariffs, broader trade tensions — such as U.S. tariffs on Canadian
canola and retaliatory measures — have created ripple effects across the grain sector. These tensions have
pressured Canadian exporters to seek alternative markets and maintain competitive pricing amidst rising logistical
and compliance costs. Some producers have responded by shifting growing-area from canola to spring wheat,
temporarily boosting wheat supply but also increasing vulnerability to price fluctuations. Wheat exports – MY 2024/2025
Spring wheat export destinations continue to include traditional markets like Indonesia, Japan, and Bangladesh.
Export volumes are tracking close to or slightly above MY 2023/24 levels, driven by tight global supply and
competitive pricing. A weaker Canadian dollar (≈ US$0.7308 by July 2025) enhanced cash returns when converted to local currency.
Durum export volumes surged in MY 2024/25, reaching 5.04 million MT YTD (August to May), driven by
increases in demand over the same time last year from Algeria (up by 608,308 MT), Italy (up by 462,932 MT),
Morocco (up by 297,935 MT), and Spain (up by 107,007 MT). Canadian durum supply was 35 percent larger than
the previous year on an increase in area planted and improved yields.

As of March 31, 2025, Statistics Canada reported that total wheat stocks in Canada were down 1.2 percent year-
over-year, reaching 15.4 million MT. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in on-farm stocks, which fell
by 7.6 percent to 11.3 million MT, while commercial stocks increased by 22.6 percent to 4.1 million MT.
Net year-end MY 2024/25 stocks (ie. July stocks) are forecast to be leaner than the previous year, raising concerns
about supply pressure if MY 2025/26 production is below trend due to drought conditions. Figure 2: March storage stocks Data source: Statistics Canada
# POLICY
### The Varietal Registration System
The Prairie Recommending Committee for Wheat, Rye, and Triticale (PRCWRT) has recently updated its
approach for approving new varieties in Prairie Provinces. The Agronomy and Quality Evaluation Teams have
adopted more transparent frameworks for evaluating performance traits, including clearly defined thresholds for
both positive and negative deviations from reference (check) varieties. Now, only when a candidate variety falls
below the acceptable threshold is a full committee discussion triggered. The Disease Evaluation Team now uses a
similar system to identify potential challenges in gaining approval.
PRCWRT states that these updates make it easier to assess the overall value of a new variety. In 2024 and 2025,
47 wheat variety candidates were submitted for evaluation. Of these, 46 received support, three were voluntarily 8

## Page 10

withdrawn, and only one failed to gain approval. Despite this success rate, only a few of these new varieties are
expected to represent more than one percent of total wheat acreage. Attachments:
